<p style="color:white"> This video was a personal video that I wanted to make using the glitch aspect with it. This one was made to make an interesting and entertaining introduction to some videos that I wanted to make, with my original name. I would have to say that I am most proud of this piece on this page due to how well the glitch editing works with the video. This was also the first time I used the application Adobe After Effects and I am glad of how it turned out in the end even though it was my first time using it.

<p style="color:white">The art pieces represent some of the emotions and activities I go through while in quarantine. This past year with COVID spreading this pandemic made these many months feel like a glitch in everyone lives. People are not feeling like themselves anymore before the pandemic starts and they feel like a glitch because they are unable to accept the changes that they will have to endure until their glitch life is fixed. I made these pieces using some of my black and white photos I took and converted them into BPM files. I would then import the files into the audio application Audacity and made the file echo and reverbed them.
